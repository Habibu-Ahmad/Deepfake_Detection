##  Overview

This project implements a deepfake detection system using both machine learning and deep learning approaches. It processes facial images to classify them as either **real** or **fake** by leveraging handcrafted visual features and deep neural representations. Traditional ML models were developed and evaluated alongside a deep learning baseline based on the [Meso4 CNN architecture](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.00888), commonly used in prior deepfake research.

##  Dataset & Preprocessing

The dataset used in this project is a **large, real-world deepfake dataset** collected from various internet sources. It contains compressed `.tar.gz` archives hosting thousands of facial images extracted from videos. The dataset is publicly available on Hugging Face:  
ðŸ”— [WildDeepfake on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/xingjunm/WildDeepfake/tree/main/deepfake_in_the_wild)

Custom preprocessing scripts were developed to:
- Extract `.png` images from `.tar.gz` archives
- Organize and clean the images into labeled directories
- Extract six meaningful image-based features:
  - Entropy
  - Blur
  - Noise
  - Keypoints
  - Blobs
  - Phase unwrapping

These features were compiled into a structured dataset for machine learning models.

##  Methodology

###  Traditional Machine Learning Models (Scikit-learn)
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **XGBoost**

These models were trained using the extracted features and evaluated using standard performance metrics.

###  Deep Learning Model
- **Meso4 CNN (TensorFlow/Keras)**  
  A compact convolutional neural network that processes raw images and learns spatial representations without manual feature engineering.
